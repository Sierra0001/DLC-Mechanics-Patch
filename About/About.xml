[h1]Mod Version: v1.0[/h1]


Tired of having to subscribe to a whole bunch of mods that does similar things to Royalty and Ideology mechanics? Rather have 1 mod that does it all?

This is a simple mod that patches various DLC mechanics. The files are easily customisable to anyone with rudimentary XML skills (or let's face it, reading skills).

[*]Removes Royalty pawn apparel requirements.

Join the Discord (link below) for troubleshooting and bug reports. Steam is a terrible platform for support and I will not be using it to deal with anything longer than a simple answer.
